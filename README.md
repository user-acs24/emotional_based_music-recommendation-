this is a CNN deep learning project using 
necessary libraries for building and training a neural network using Keras and TensorFlow, including data manipulation with Pandas, numerical operations with NumPy, visualization with Matplotlib, and loading datasets from TensorFlow Datasets. It also imports various components required for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN), such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, dense layers, batch normalization, dropout, and callbacks for model training control.
